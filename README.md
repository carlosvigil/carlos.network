## personal website

My first live website and also my personal blog, possibly portfolio. I'll add
things like opinion pieces and document my journey coding. I have a YouTube
channel for the same purpose and will embed videos into blog posts here. I plan
to add links to my social networks like: LinkedIn and Twitter.
