I mention this because I'd like to promote and develop the mobile revolution and a minimal lifestyle.</p><p>It's been irritating at best to follow this motion, when dealing with others, but to me the benefits are worth doing so. Besides, what's the use in doing something if you're going to let others bring you down?</p><p>"Where there's a will there's a way."</p><p>Most of the issue resides in misconceptions. ("they" from here on refers to the general populace) They, believe these devices are a sort of luxury or consumer device, as in it's only purpose is to consume, i.e. entertainment. But I saw them as well designed, portable computers. And so I do all my work on it.</p><p>Part of the switch, or maybe my own preference, says that my iPad is too big. I can't hold it in one hand comfortably, so I will pass this one on in favor of a Mini 4.</p><p class="text-xs-center "><b>. . .</b></p><p>I didn't get the Mini 4.<br />But, K got a Mini 2.</p><br /><hr /><!-- LUMOID POST --><h4>Tested out 5 wearables with the gf. Rented the Pebble Watch, Fitbit Charge HR, Striiv Fusion, Garmin Viv&oacute;smart, and Moov from <a href="http://www.lumoid.com/" target="_blank">Lumoid</a>.</h4><p>Interestingly enough, I knew I didn't need any of them, that they'd be more annoyance than practical gadget. But, I still went along with it and K was kind enough to do so with me. Long story short the Moov is the only winner and only because I have an interest in improving my running and K likes tracking her calories burned now. <a href="https://moov.cc/getmoov/1B6329B57B" target="_blank">Moov</a> is now offering their next generation device at discount increments of 40, 50, and 60 percent depending on how many you order.</p><span>lumoid notes</span><ul><li>pebble watch charger sucks; weak magnets, falls off a lot</li><li>Striiv charger better</li><li>both light</li><li>both feel good (haven&#8217;t worn yet)</li><li>pebble apps are exciting</li><li>kind of annoying to have both wrists vibrating about lifeline</li><li>pebble is useful, more info, bigger screen, easier to read</li><li>striiv fusion is difficult to read. bad angles.</li><li>games in pebble are fun</li></ul><br /><hr /><!-- BRAND POST --><h4>Starting my brand.</h4><br /><h5>This content marks the beginning of my self marketing and brand development, or simply, blogging.</h5><p>To start off I&#8217;ll add links to what I&#8217;ve been up to, learning to program. I&#8217;ve started a <a href="https://goo.gl/Ct5Z9h">YouTube channel</a> to retain the knowledge and practice communicating ideas. I&#8217;ll describe that experience in another entry. I&#8217;ve done various work scattered throughout the learning websites like: <i>Code School</i>, <i>Codecademy</i>, <i>The Odin Project</i>, and <i>Launch School</i>. For ease of use and on a basis of popularity, I&#8217;ll link <a href="https://goo.gl/9UJmNN"><i>FreeCodeCamp</i></a>. There, anyone can track my learning in that program.</p><br /><hr /><!-- RANDOM POST --><p>01010100011010000110100101110011001000000110100101110011001000000111001001101001011001000110100101100011011101010110110001101111011101010111001100100000011011000110111101101100001011000010000001101000011011110111011100100000011010010111001100100000011000010110111001111001011011110110111001100101001000000110011101101111011011100110111001100001001000000111001001100101011000010110010000100000011101000110100001100001011101000011111100100001</p><br /><hr /><!-- MACBOOK POST --><h4>First Mac[book]</h4><p>Well, well. I got a Macbook Pro. Apparently, it’s the early 2015 one, or maybe they mean that’s the design date. It was updated a few months ago with a better processor and a force touch trackpad (from what the rep told me). It’s taking a little getting used to, to type and spread my fingers more since the keyboard is wider. Also, there’s no double space shortcut for punctuation.</p><div class="footer">Written &amp; designed by Carlos Vigil.</div><br /></body></html>
