Well, well. I got a Macbook Pro. Apparently, it’s the early 2015 one, or maybe they mean that’s the design date. It was updated a few months ago with a better processor and a force touch trackpad. It’s taking a little getting used to, to type and spread my fingers more since the keyboard is wider. Also, there’s no double space shortcut for punctuation.
