lumoid notes

- pebble watch charger sucks; weak magnets, falls off a lot
- Striiv charger better
- both light
- both feel good (haven't worn yet)
- pebble apps are exciting
- kind of annoying to have both wrists vibrating about lifeline
- pebble is useful, more info, bigger screen, easier to read
- striiv fusion is difficult to read. bad angles.
- games in pebble are fun
