# Starting my brand.

## This content marks the beginning of my self marketing and brand development, or simply, blogging.

To start off I'll add links to what I've been up to, learning to program. I've started a [YouTube channel](https://goo.gl/Ct5Z9h) to retain the knowledge and practice communicating ideas. I'll describe that experience in another entry. I've done various work scattered throughout the learning websites like: _Code School_, _Codecademy_, _The Odin Project_, and _Launch School_. For ease of use and on a basis of popularity, I'll link [_FreeCodeCamp_](https://goo.gl/9UJmNN). There anyone can track my learning in that program.
